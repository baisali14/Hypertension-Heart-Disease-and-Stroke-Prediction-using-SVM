Resultant output with these values : No hypertension, No heart disease, No stroke

# Introduction
This Machine Learning project is aimed at predicting three different factors all at the same time depending on different Diagnostic aspects. The factors are as follows:<br>
    (a) A person has hypertension or not. <br>
    (b) A person has heart disease or not. <br>
    (c) A person has stroke or not. <br>
<br>
The dataset being used to make the predictive model is the Stroke Prediction Dataset. The different attributes of the dataset include - id, gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, residence_type, avg_glucose_level bmi, smoking_status, stroke.

# Technologies Used
This Machine Learning project was implemented using Python Programming Language. The different libraries being used are: <br>
      * Scikit-learn  <br>
      * Pandas <br>
      * Numpy <br>
      * Pickle <br>
      * Seaborn <br>
     
# Data Collection and Analysis
The dataset used in this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset. The dataset has 12 attributes. They are: <br>
1) id: unique identifier <br>
2) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other" <br>
3) age: age of the patient <br>
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension <br>
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease <br>
6) ever_married: "No" or "Yes" <br>
7) work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed" <br>
8) Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban" <br>
9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood <br>
10) bmi: body mass index <br>
11) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown" <br>
12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not <br>
